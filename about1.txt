There are 4 steps in the git first the untracked file we created is in the step 4(i.e working directory)
then the files we need to put in the repo or the files we need to save if there is any pc crash we 
need to move them to the step 1 (i.e remote repository) so from step 4 to step 1 in between them there
are 2 steps,step 3(i.e stagging area) and step 2(i.e local repo).stagging area is where we need to save the
progess so we move the files from step 4 to step 3 by using git add command here we can choose
the files we want to send to the local repo and from step 3 to step 2 by using git commit command and in this
step we can move the entire files from the stagging to local and then we can move the files from local to remote
by using git push command.
