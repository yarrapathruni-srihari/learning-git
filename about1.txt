There are 4 steps in the git first the untracked file we created is in the step 4(i.e working directory)
then the files we need to put in the repo or the files we need to save if there is any pc crash we 
need to move them to the step 1 (i.e remote repository) so from step 4 to step 1 in between them there
are 2 steps,step 3(i.e stagging area) and step 2(i.e local repo).stagging area is where we need to save the
progess so we move the files from step 4 to step 3 by using git add command here we can choose
the files we want to send to the local repo and from step 3 to step 2 by using git commit command and in this
step we can move the entire files from the stagging to local and then we can move the files from local to remote
by using git push command.

2. lets learn about branching for any repo there is a master/main branch so if there are 10 people if they work on
same branch it's create mess and it's difficult for them to make changes so they will create 10 copies and each
of them will work on their own copies and push that changes to the copied branch and after they raise a
pull request and ask the owner to merge it into the main branch and if he agrees if merge it and deploy.

3."git branch" gives the details of the branches present in the repo.

4. "git checkout "branchname" " is used for jumping from one branch to another branch.

5. "git checkout -b "branchname" it will create a new branch if the branchname doesn't exist.

6. "fork" in the github means that we are creating a copy the main branch and we can make changes without
affecting the original code and after we changed we can raise a pull request to merge it in the original
branch.
